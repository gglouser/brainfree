-- This is a convenient way to convert 'Cell' to 'Char' and vice versa,
-- since both are Enums.

-- and an action to write a cell to the data array.
-- The default behavior is to leave the current cell value unchagned.

data Stream = Cell :> Stream

-- from or written to by a notional /tape head/ that can be moved left
-- or right along the tape. Also track the current position relative
-- to the /data pointer/.

-- | A VectorMem consists of a mutable 'Vector' of 'Cell's and an
-- index that acts as a pointer to the current cell.
data VectorMem = VM (V.IOVector Cell) !Int

-- | Allocate a new VectorMem with the given size, with all elements
-- initialized to zero and the pointer pointing to the first element,
-- and then run the given action using the new VectorMem.

-- * Foreign pointer/array memory

type FPtrMem = Ptr Cell

-- initialized to zero and the pointer pointing to the first element,
-- and then run the given action using the new 'FPtrMem'.
