-- | This type is used as the unit of memory by all of our bf machines.
type Cell = Word8

-- | Convert between 'Enum' types.
-- This is a convenient way to convert 'Cell' to 'Char' and vice versa,
-- since both are Enums.

-- and an action for the loop body.

-- * Infinite tape memory

-- | An infinite stream of 'Cell's

-- from or written to by a notional /tape head/ that can be moved left
-- or right along the tape.

-- | A VectorMem consists of a mutable 'Vector' of 'Cell's and an
-- index that acts as a pointer to the current cell.
data VectorMem = VM (V.IOVector Cell) !Int

-- initialized to zero and the pointer pointing to the first element,
-- and then run the given action using the new VectorMem.

-- initialized to zero and the pointer pointing to the first element,
