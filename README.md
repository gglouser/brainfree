brainfree - brainfuck for free
===============================

[Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programming
language well-known for its simplicity. That simplicity makes it difficult to
write programs in brainfuck, but also makes it easy to write interpreters and
compilers for the language.

BrainFree is a brainfuck interpreter in Haskell that uses a free monad named
BF as an intermediate layer. The BF monad specifies the capabilities of an abstract 
brainfuck machine. Once the program is in this form, we can evaluate it in 
different ways corresponding to different concrete implementations of the abstract 
brainfuck machine. Three "back ends" are provided, selectable with command line 
option:

- `-v` -- a mutable unboxed Vector (default)
- `-f` -- a Foreign pointer into an array
- `-t` -- an infinite stream-based tape

### Usage summary ###

    usage: brainfree [FLAGS] SOURCEFILE
    
    Flags:
    -o      enable optimizations
    -v      use Vector data store (default)
    -f      use Foreign array data store
    -t      use infinite tape data store
    -c      generate C code
    -h      generate Haskell code

### Performance ###

Performance is not expected to be comparable to a highly optimizing interpreter.
The sample runtimes below are just to give a sense of the relative performance
of the different runtime options.

Sample runtimes (completely unscientific) of long.bf:

| Data store   | No optimization | With optimization |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Vector (-v)  |         104.68s |            16.91s |
| Foreign (-f) |          87.89s |            14.48s |
| Tape (-t)    |         497.72s |           141.26s |

The BF Monad
-------------

Let's interpret brainfuck using a free monad!

Here is a (simplified) functor that represents the things the abstract
brainfuck machine can do (where Cell is the type stored in the data array,
classically one byte):

    data BFF k = MovePtr Int k          -- move the data pointer
               | ReadPtr (Cell -> k)    -- read from the data pointer
               | WritePtr Cell k        -- write to the data pointer
               | GetChar (Char -> k)    -- accept input
               | PutChar Char k         -- send output

This is not the only possible functor that can represent brainfuck programs,
and indeed, if you look at the actual BrainFree implementation, you will
see some differences to support some optimizations and handling end-of-file.
It has the nice property that data pointer operations and I/O are decoupled.

Now we can translate brainfuck programs into the free monad on BFF,
specifically `Free BFF ()` because they do not produce any value. Here is
how each basic command can be implemented:

| Command | Translation                          |
|:-------:|--------------------------------------|
| `>`     | `movePtr   1`                        |
| `<`     | `movePtr (-1)`                       |
| `+`     | `readPtr >>= \n -> writePtr (n + 1)` |
| '-'     | `readPtr >>= \n -> writePtr (n - 1)` |
| '.'     | `readPtr >>= putChar . cellToChar`   |
| ','     | `getChar >>= writePtr . charToCell`  |

In the actual implementation, we represent the program using a regular
algebraic data type first because that form lends itself much better
to static optimization. The program in BF monad form has code
hidden behind lambdas.

Loops *could* be implemented using the full power of recursion and monads.
Assume that a loop body (everything between a balanced pair of `[...]`)
has already been translated into our monad `Free BFF ()`. Then the loop is:

    loop body = do x <- readPtr
                   when (x /= 0) $ body >> loop body

This works, but it turns out to be slower than we would like. I believe this 
is because we have to re-interpret the free monad actions inside the loop at 
every iteration. If we add another action to our functor to represent loops, 
`Loop (Free BFF ()) k`, then it is possible to interpret the loop body 
just once. The downside is that every interpreter of Free BFF is now required 
to implement the correct loop behavior. The upside is that programs run
much faster.

### End-of-file ###

In order to handle end-of-file conditions, the actual form of GetChar is
`GetChar (Maybe Char -> k)`. The default behavior if `Nothing` is returned
is to leave the current cell's value unchanged. A back end implementation
could support one of the other "standard" end-of-file behaviors by
returning `Just (coerce (0::Cell))` or `Just (coerce (-1::Cell))`, or
equivalent, instead of Nothing.

I took inspiration from
[SamB's BF interpreter](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Short_examples/BF_interpreter)
which parses a brainfuck program directly into IO monad actions, and shows how
to use a Foreign pointer into an array as a data store.
